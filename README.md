BitMessage is a cross platform app licenced under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International Public License allowing for fully decentralized and encrypted communications leveraging the already implemented blockchain encryption protocols.
It allows for either using our server as a temporary routing server where messages are deleted as soon as they are received or sending messages directly through the blockchain.

FUTURE PLANS :
- Add a federated server architecture where anyone can be a node
- Integrate multiple blockchain backends (Solidity VM, Bitcoin, Solana)

TODO :
- evaluate security risks of imported crypto packages
- change/reimplement unsafe functions as needed
